A= diag(3, 5, 5) #simply make a 3 diagonal matrix 
B= diag(0, 5, 5) #simply make a 0 diagonal matrix
C= sweep(B, 1, c(1,0,0,0,0), "+") # Using sweep function I added 1 to first row
D= sweep(B, 2, c(2,0,0,0,0), "+") # Using sweep function I added 2 to first column
E= C+D 
F= E+A #I didn't know how to subtract only one cell in matrix and also I couldn't find any hint in our resources to do such operation
